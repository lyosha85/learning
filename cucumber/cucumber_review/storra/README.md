Storra
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/basti1302/storra.png)](https://travis-ci.org/basti1302/storra)

A prototypical REST storage service based on [Node.js] (http://nodejs.org/). Currently, only [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and two in-memory databases, [node-dirty](https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty) and [nStore](https://github.com/creationix/nstore), can be used as the storage backend. Other storage backends might be added in future versions.

Right now, this package basically wraps MongoDB (or one of the in-memory databases) in a RESTful http interface. Only basic CRUD operations on collections and single documents are supported, queries are not yet implemented.

Setup
-----

* Storra runs on Node.js, so obviously you need to have Node.js installed. Anything from version 0.8.21 upwards should do. Go to http://nodejs.org/ and click on the green button that says "Install", or follow https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
* `git clone https://github.com/basti1302/storra.git`
* If you just want to *use* Storra:
    * `npm install`
* If you want to *develop* Storra:
    * `npm install -g jasmine-node@~1.2.3`
    * `npm install -g cucumber@~0.3.0`
    * `npm install -g grunt-cli
    * Optional, but recommended: `npm install -g supervisor`
    * `npm install`
* You can edit `storra.yml` to configure Storra, see below.
* `node lib\index.js` to start Storra.

### Note for Windows Users

If you get the following error or something similar during `npm install`:

```shell
npm WARN `git config --get remote.origin.url` returned wrong result (git://github.com/magicmoose/grunt-jasmine-node.git)

npm ERR! git clone git://github.com/magicmoose/grunt-jasmine-node.git

```

It might be due to this problem: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/2333 - or you might have chosen to not add git to your PATH during the installation of git. The solution is to update to the latest version of Git for Windows or to do `npm install` from within the GitBash instead of using the command prompt.

Configuration
-------------

Since the configuration file format YAML and YAML is hierarchic, configuration is split in sections. Currently there are the following sections:

* core
* mongodb

No section needs to be present. None of the possible options needs to be present. Unknown sections are ignored as well as unknown values.

### Section core

* port - the port on which Storra listens for connections. Default is 1302.
* bindAddress - The IP address on which Storra listens for connections. Default is 0.0.0.0.
* backend - the persistence backend to use. Possible values:
    * `'./backends/node_dirty_backend'` - node-dirty (Default)
    * `'./backends/nstore_backend'` - nStore
    * `'./backends/mongodb_backend'` - MongoDB

### Section mongodb
If you use the MongoDB backend, you can configure some more options specific to MongoDB. If you use a different backend, these options are ignored.
* connectionMaxRetries - How often Storra tries to connect to MongoDB if the connection can not be established on the first try. Default is 20.
* connectionTimeBetweenRetries - How many milliseconds to wait before trying again. Default is 50.
* database - The MongoDB database Storra will use.

Usage
-----

* POST to / to create a new collection
* GET /collection to list a collection of documents
* POST to /collection to create a new document
* GET /collection/key to retrieve a document
* PUT /collection/key to update a document
* DELETE /collection/key to delete a document

Non-existing collections are created on the fly when you create a document in them (but not if you GET a non-existing collection or a document in a non-existing collection).
